* Gui dotfiles
This is one of two parts of my configuration. As the name suggests, this
repository tracks the configuration of all things graphical.
** Requirements
 At the moment this config support i3-gaps and bspwm. This means i3-gaps or 
 bspwm+sxhkd need to be installed, in addtion to the following packages.
 - compton
 - rxvt-unicode
 - rofi
 rxvt-unicode and rofi can be substituted using similar packages, for example
 termite and dmenu
 
 Furthermore polybar can be used to provide a status bar.
